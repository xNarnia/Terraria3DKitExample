# Terraria3DKit Library Example - Version 0.2
A library used to perform 3D modeling and rendering within Terraria. Designed with ease of use as its highest priority.

# Note:
This library is in very alpha stages and you could experience performance issues as well as major bugs! 
<br>When using this library, make sure to test on multiple machines for performance profiling and to test using different zooms.

<br>Besides, we already know you're beautiful.
